# Hora
Source code for the album Hora. To run any songs, use [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and first edit and run config.rb. You can find a recorded version of this EP [here](https://beguiledbyguillotining.bandcamp.com/album/hora).

Songs:
1. Side A - Bee
2. Side B - Not Bee 1
3. Side Bee - Not Bee 2

Running the songs yourself requires a MIDI device. I used an Akai LPD8.

Side A - Bee uses a synth from [SCLOrkSynths](https://github.com/SCLOrkHub/SCLOrkSynths). The recorded version includes some live editing of of the code.

Side B - Not Bee 1 and Side Bee - Not Bee 2 where made using the same code.
